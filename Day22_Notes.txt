---- The process of parallel execution -----
1- We need 2 plugins
-- FailSafe
-- Surefire
2- For report we need maven-cucumber-report plugin
-- we created TestRunner named runner classes
Because our plugin says -- include TestRunner --
WE added tags to our runner classes to run our tags simultanously -- at the same time.
-- The command for maven to run all runner classes -- mvn clean verify -- mvn install verify



Cucumber Parallel Testing:
Step 1: Add Cucumber Failsafe Plugin
Step 2: Add Cucumber Surefire Plugin
------
Step 3: Add Cucumber reporting plugin for better visual reports
